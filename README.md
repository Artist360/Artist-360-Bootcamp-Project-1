# Artist-360-Bootcamp-Project-1

I followed the example listed here to get the autherization going:
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/js

i used the client id from this:
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=artist-360-app
im figuring out whats the difference between a client id and api

had to install a web server because i think the youtube api is required to use one?

this article explains it a bit:
